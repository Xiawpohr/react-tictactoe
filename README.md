## Demo
[https://xiawpohr.github.io/react-tictactoe/](https://xiawpohr.github.io/react-tictactoe/)

## Improvements

* Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
* Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
* Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
* Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
* When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
* When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
